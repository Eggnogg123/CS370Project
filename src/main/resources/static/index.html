                <p class = "para">The goal of our software is to determine the likelihood of 
                    mental health issues based on various factors like 
                    size of workplace, age, accessibility of resources, 
                    among other factors. </p>
                <p class = "para">Data from the World Health Organization(WHO) 
                    and Center for Disease Control(C.D.C) shows 1 in 8 people 
                    have a mental illness and that over 49,000 people died by 
                    suicide in 2022â€”1 death every 11 minutes. Furthermore, according 
                    to the CDC using data from 27 states, 46% of suicide decedents were 
                    known to have mental health conditions. Therefore addressing the mental 
                    illness issue and raising awareness is tantamount to a healthy society. 
                    We developed a software that is powered by the random forest algorithm and 
                    fed data from the "Mental Health in Tech Survey" dataset. 
                    Our model was shown to accurately and quickly predict (change this later depending on results) 
                    the likelihood of the presence of mental illness.</p>
